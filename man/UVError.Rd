\title{
Calculation of the elements of the 2D MSE terms}
\description{
This function calculates the different terms in the 2D MSE equation, the rotation of EOFs and so on for a unique given model. This function is internally used by \code{SailoR.Indices()} and external users are not expected to use it.
}
\usage{
UVError(U, V, Ensembles = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{U}{
a vector including the zonal and meridional components of the reference dataset.}
  \item{V}{
a vector including the zonal and meridional components of the model being compared.}
  \item{Ensembles}{
if \code{Ensembles} is set to \code{TRUE}, M different models included in the data frame \code{mod} will be taken as a single model and the reference model is repeated M times for the calculation of the Sailor diagram.
