\title{
Calculation of indices for Sailor Diagram
}
\description{
This function returns all statistics used by the Sailor diagram for the set of different models in data frame \code{mod} with the reference in data frame \code{ref}.
}
\usage{
SailoR.Indices(ref, mod, Ensembles = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ref}{
A data frame with the reference observations. It should have 3 columns: name, zonal component and meridional component.
}
  \item{mod}{
A data frame with the model data. It should have 3 columns: name, zonal component and meridional component. More than one model can be included under different names. \code{nrows(mod)} must be an integer multiple of \code{nrows(ref)}. 
}
  \item{Ensembles}{
If \code{Ensembles} is set to \code{TRUE}, M different models included in the data frame \code{mod} will be taken as a single model and the reference model is repeated M times for the calculation of the Sailor diagram. 
}
}
\value{
The result is a data frame with a summary of the statistics obtained:

\item{meanU}{mean of the U dataset.}
\item{meanV}{mean of the V dataset.}
\item{RMSE}{root mean square error between U and V.}
\item{sdUx}{standard deviation of zonal component (U).}
\item{sdUy}{standard deviation of meridional component (U).}
\item{sdVx}{standard deviation of zonal component (V).}
\item{sdVy}{standard deviation of meridional component (V).}
\item{Eu}{EOF matrix for the U dataset.}
\item{Ev}{EOF matrix for the V dataset.}
\item{Sigmau}{matrix with standard deviations of U (2x2 matrix).}
\item{Sigmav}{matrix with standard deviations of V (2x2 matrix).}
\item{TotVarU}{total variance of the U dataset.}
\item{TotVarV}{total variance of the V dataset.}
\item{thetau}{angle of EOF1 (U) with zonal axis.}
\item{thetav}{angle of EOF1 (V) with meridional axis.}
\item{thetavu}{rotation angle from U EOFs to V EOFs.}
\item{R2vec}{vector correlation squared in 2D as defined by Breaker, Gemmill and Crossby (1994).}
\item{Rvu}{rotation matrix to express Ev as a rotation from Eu.}
